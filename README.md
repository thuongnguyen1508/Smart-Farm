## 1. About The Project

This web has been created to contribute to the agriculture sector with a more automatic way of managing devices remotely by using IOT technology concepts.

Some basic features included in this website for customers: login, add/edit/remove devices of their farm, statistics dashboard, and remote device control.

What did I integrate into this project?
* Adafruit API to connect with gateway IOT which communicates with various sensors (through pub/sub protocol). (temperature, humidity, sound sensors) 
* Reasonable design patterns: Repository, DI, Strategy.
* Chart.js API for representing data in more significant ways
